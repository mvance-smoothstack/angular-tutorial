    pipes: a functional way to format passed-in props
    https://angular.io/guide/pipes
    works client-side (example: updating the hero name below)
    Angular strips all these comments on compilation
-->

<!-- part 2: display a list -->
<h2>My Heroes</h2>
<ul class="heroes">
    <!-- repeater directive: makes instances of a host element (here, li) for each prop element in a list (each hero in the heroes we pass in) -->
    <!-- click event binding: when bound, it listens for a click and executes whatever expression is specified, such as a function -->
    <!-- class binding: adds a class when an expression evaluates to true, such as the hero passed in being equal to selectedHero -->
    <!-- splitting element declarations like this is fine, and useful for elements with lots of things bound to them -->
    <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes" 
    (click)="onSelect(hero)" 
    [class.selected]="hero === selectedHero">
        <span class="badge">{{hero.id}}</span> {{hero.name}}
    </li>
</ul>

<!-- the "ng" in these directives probably short for "Angular," as with invoking it at the command line -->
<!-- ngIf is a directive that means, if the specified expression evaluates to true, include this part of the template -->
<div *ngIf="selectedHero">
    <h2>{{selectedHero.name | uppercase}} Details</h2>
    <div><span>id: </span>{{selectedHero.id}}</div>
    <div>
        <label>name:
            <!-- two-way data binding using ngModel; data flows from the class to fill the input and to the screen, and from the screen back to the class -->
            <input [(ngModel)]="selectedHero.name" placeholder="name" />
        </label>
    </div>
</div>
